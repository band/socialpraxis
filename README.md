# SocialPraxis

The technics and practices of the so-called "socials", exemplified in
2024 by Bluesky, the Mastodon collection of instances, Meta's threads
and Instagram, and others.  

One aim of this wiki is to collect information and opinions on these topics. A second is to construct some sensible descriptions of how these technologies interoperate as a larger social web. That these systems can, and do, provide a usable and useful social web is an
empirical question.
