# The socials - notes on practices

The socials - notes on praxis, and more ....  
TODO: need a separate wiki for notes and posts on technology, socials, and associated praxis.  
- this needs a wiki name and a repo, and more posts  
	- "Social Technics", "technosocial",  
	- 2024-12-27: leaning toward "technsocial praxis"  

my own post describing the socials:  
> [**anderbill** @band](https://hachyderm.io/@band "band")  2024-09-27:  
  the set of socials is a collection of silos, some with moats, connected by ad-hoc bridges, some of which only support traffic one-way. is this the current fediverse?

[[Decentralization - and Bluesky]]  
excerpts:  
- "... the fediverse works like email ..."  
 > ActivityPub's architecture is ... designed for direct communication _first and foremost_... public communication is clearly supported, but the default and simplest case is direct individual or group messaging.  

see [[my socials federation info]] for notes on how I think my own separate socials accounts are currently connected, or bridged
